# Step 1: Initialize the repository

## Objective

Create the minimum structure for a Git-like repository to store files and commits.

## Structure created

.mygit/
├── objects/ # stores files (blobs) and commits
├── refs/ # stores branch references (e.g., master)
└── HEAD # points to the current branch

## Key concepts

- **HEAD**: points to the current branch. Initially set to `refs/master`.  
- **refs/**: contains references to branches.  
- **objects/**: stores file contents and commits.  

## Notes

- The init() function is equivalent to git init and should be run only once per project.
- After this step, the repository is ready to add files and make commits.
